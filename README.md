# PWA-weather

Google's Progressive App showing :
- Registering, installing and activating serviceWorker
- Caching static assets in local cache
- Calling API in the first request and then saving the response in cache to future requests
- Demo of 2 async requests - one to the local cache and other to live API to show the initial rendering from local app and then update as soon as live api responds. Heart of progressive web app behavior
- Usage of app in offline environment
